"""
Variables can be set in the code, so that the programmer
does not have to waste time repeating the code over and over.
Typically, variables are numeric or are special characters,
words or letters, set by the coder before use. Int is a numeric variable, 
and is usually supposed to be a whole integer and float is also numeric, but 
decimals are included, even if the number is whole, so a float integer

Typically, bool variable, also known as a true/false
variable indicates if something is true ortr false or a boolean variable
and str represents a string/text type of code, which is
the only one that has double quotations.
